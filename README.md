# Arduino-UNO-EEPROM-to-replace-Combinational-Logic
We replace any combinational logic circuit by programming the truth table into a ROM and the data bits.

Logic gates can be utilized to implement complex logic functions in a circuit, but doing all the necessary calculations can be a tedious and time-consuming process. However, memory chips can serve as a simple alternative because they can also be used to represent logic functions.

Work well turns out you can replace any combinational logic circuit with a ROM and so rather than having to design this complicated circuit with all of those gates, we could replace all of them with a ROM that's because remember where this came from we started with this basic truth table which just describes how the data bits coming about whether the segments are turned ON or OFF well we can program this truth table into a ROM and the data bits.
